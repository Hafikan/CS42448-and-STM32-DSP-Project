This project aims to develop a DSP (Digital Signal Processing) project using STM32F303 and STM32H7 microcontrollers. The project targets processing and manipulation of audio signals using the CS42448 audio codec.
Features

    Compatible with STM32F303 and STM32H7 boards
    Integration with CS42448 audio codec
    Implementation of DSP algorithms (e.g., FIR and IIR filtering, FFT, audio effects, etc.)
    Optimization of hardware and software resources
    Sample projects for easy integration and usage

Requirements

    STM32CubeIDE or similar IDE
    STM32F303 or STM32H7 board
    CS42448 audio codec
    Wiring and mounting materials
